title: KDE Neon
---

I have decided to move from GNOME or Cinnamon or XFCE or Unity to try again finally the new KDE Plasma.
In fact, I have decided to try the whole KDE Neon distro which is basically KDE Plasma 5.8 with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I know, I know, Ubuntu is not my favourite distribution (I will always remember my first Debian, Linuxmint Debian or my days with Fedora...) but I have to admit that Ubuntu simply works in any laptop I have tried it.

I have decided for KDE Neon because my intention was to really give an opportunity to KDE. I had tried it once and I really went crazy with all the things different to GNOME (I know now that I was too newbie on Linux and too used to GNOME Desktop and its tools...) but know that I have a better knowledge of the Terminal, the available tools and that I have reading wonderful comments about Plasma... why not? let's give a try.

The first thing that has impressed me is the low memory consumption (only 400 MB at first and now around 700MB). One important thing: if your laptop is not very powerful or it is a little bit old, I recommend you to desactivate the desktop animations. It still looks really good and it gets really much faster.

By the moment I have installed LibreOffice, Emacs, Krusader, RStudio, Spyder, TexStudio and Retropie (I have to make a post about Retrogaming...) ;-) and everything goes smooth and nice. I need to explore much better all the capabilities of KDE (specially the "activities" and KDE Connect) and I will tell you soon with much more detail how I find KDE after being working mostly with XFCE and Unity.

Oh, one last thing I have installed is Clementine (I don't really like Amarok very much).


Thanks for reading and see you soon.
