*Sed fugit interea, fugit inreparabile tempus*

Time flies and never comes back.

When I was younger, I used to think that I could finish no matter what as soon as it was necessary (lab reports in 2 days,
preparing exams in one week, programming exercises in one night...)

After my first steps in research and development of scientific tools, I realized that management is really important
if you don't want to become a shipwreck survivor in the ocean of un-finished projects, papers and code.

Maybe the first step is accepting that your new professional tasks are not easy,
there will be unexpected problems and it is going to take days, weeks or even months to finish them.
Therefore, you need to track them properly and find ways to motivate yourself during this neverending tasks.

Another interesting appreciation is that I consider my personal life and my research/developer life the same.
I cannot focus at work if there is something bothering me such us paying my taxes or calling the bank office
or organizing a trip to Sevilla and I cannot sleep well if there is something at work not finished (weird model results,
doing some data visualization or preparing a presentation). Therefore, I try to organize them together. Of course,
I work my 8 hours a day in the office and I do my personal stuff before or after (or I take holidays for long issues),
but organize my calender, my tasks and my general plans considering both at the same time.
