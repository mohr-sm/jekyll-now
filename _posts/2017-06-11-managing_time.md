title: Tempus Fugit
---

*Sed fugit interea, fugit inreparabile tempus*

Time flies and never comes back.

When I was younger, I used to think that I could finish no matter what as soon as it was necessary 
(lab reports in 2 days, preparing exams in one week, programming exercises in one night...)

After my first steps in research and development of scientific software tools, 
I have realized that management and progress monitoring are really important if 
you don't want to become a shipwreck survivor in the ocean of unfinished projects, papers and code.

Maybe the first step is accepting that your new professional tasks are not easy.
There will be unexpected problems and it is going to take days, weeks or even months to solve them.
Therefore, you need to track them properly and find ways to motivate yourself during this never ending tasks.

Another important remark is that I consider my personal life and my research/developer life the same. That means that
I cannot focus at work if there is something bothering me such as dealing with the administration 
or organizing a trip to Seville and I cannot sleep well if there is something at work not going well
 (weird model results, doing some data visualization or preparing a presentation). 
Therefore, I try to organize them together. Of course,
I work my 8 hours a day in the office and I do my personal stuff before or after (or I take holidays for long issues),
but I organize my calendar, my tasks and my general plans considering both are part the same kind of tasks.

Another point that I would like to make is that I have a 
kind of **double** or **triple** organization system.

 
+ I organize my general life and work together with [Google Keep](keep.google.com) and Calender and
my working events with [Thunderbird Lightning Calendar](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/calendar) (synchronized with my institutional account)

+ I organize projects and long-term tasks in detail using org-mode in Emacs.I will definitely do an entrance in this blog about [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) for managing projects and prepare quickly drafts for articles or reports. I will let you know ;-)

+ Finally, I use a [**bullet journal**](http://bulletjournal.com/), 
I mean a paper notebook with this system of organization. 
And two extra open source android apps: [Omni Notes](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes)(for recording voice notes) and [Loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits) (for habits).


### Let's check the details...

[Google Keep](keep.google.com) is quite practical. 
It works with a Google account, it has apps for your smartphone and tablet,
it can be used with any web browser and the main advantege is that it synchronizes! 
In this way I can create reminders using my phone or my tablet and get them in my Google account.

To plan tasks in a particular project and keep track of progress I like using org-mode](http://orgmode.org) in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
I already use Emacs for writing code, reports in LaTex, edit HTML... so why not using for planning and organization.
Using org-mode in Emacs is simply creating a text file, which I have in a folder in a calculation
server or in a cloud service, so I can access and modify it from my computer at work or at home.
This allows me to write plans, fix deadlines and write long descriptions.Therefore,
I can divide long project in small tasks, fix deadline for those intermediate steps and keep 
tracking of the progress.

At the same time I can include notes and comments and send to myself those text files by email just for backup.
The main advantage is that it is simply a text file and Emacs. No distractions, just me and my thoughts.
Finally, I use [Omni Notes](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes) in case I need to record a long voice note and 
then I just put it in Dropbox or Google Drive for back up.

And this is what I mainly use to organize my life and research.

The other android app I have mentioned is Loop. It is not really for notes or management 
but it is quite useful for create a new habit or be sure you are doing a little bit 
of something every day. For example, I wanted to force my self to learn a little bit of 
French and write a little bit of this blog every week. I 
have added those tasks to Loop and set a reminder in the evening. 
Then, Loop creates a table when you can check if you have done your 
work and see how many days in row you have keep your promise.

Finally, every morning and every evening I check my **bullet journal**, 
which is simply a paper notebook where I write and plan my stuff. 
Some times it is easier to take a pencil and plan something 
reading the notes you have already taken the last weeks. 
I know it is a little bit redundant, but it works for me!


Now you have planned your life and work, it comes the really important task: accomplishing it!

When you work in a business like mine, you really need to be focus when you are
doing your code, analyzing your data or writing a paper or a report, and that is
not easy when you are surrounded of colleagues, you have meetings or
you need to read and  answer some emails.

I would like to recommend you a couple of books at this point: 

+ **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People** by Stephen R. Covey
+ **Getting Things Done** by David Allen
+ **The Effective Executive** by Peter F. Drucker.

The first one is a quite philosophical book, it provides some advices to manage 
your time and balance your personal and professional life. The second one is much more practical book 
for organizing your tasks and your life providing a method and some good tricks. The third one is a classic book focused mostly in analyzing your daily tasks, optimizing your time and removing tasks you should not be doing.

### How do I manage tasks which cannot be planned?

Let's do some fiction. Let's say I want to write a python script to do a set of calculations and creat some figures for a project report. I have evaluated the data available, I know what kind of result I want and I have decided more or less what I want to do to get it. With all this information I have decided that it should be ready in two days. Then I start writting the script and, after 4 hours, I get stuck with something it doesn't work and it crashes in runtime...  :-( Logically, I start debugging the code, checking indexes, variables, correct syntaxis... and 3 hours later I have found the problem! Uff, great, I can continue... tomorrow. I document a little bit what I have done and go home. The next day, I arrive to the office, get my coffee and Bingo! I realize I can do something in a different way faster and I check if there is a package or function in python to do it and... Bingo again! I start installing the python package with pip and it requires some libraries I don't have installed, so apt... and ready! One hour later, everything is installed and the small example I have tried to test it works. Then I read a little bit more the documentation to implement my specific problem... and, again 3 hours later, this part of the problem is solved and I have my results and I start with the visualization. Ok, let's go... maplotlib, basemap... and... wait! what is that weird gradient in the figure... umm it should not be that way... is it something wrong doing the figure? is it something from the intermediate steps? is it in the input data? 

Conclusion, the two days you have planned for this **important task** are gone and it is not ready yet. My planning of the week is not valid any more. Frustration comes because I have not finished this and two more things I had planned because of the time I have spent solving the problems of this task.

Now just imagine that this kind of situations happen to you every week. How can you evaluate the efficience? How can you plan the progress and be satisfied? Well, it is not easy.

First of all, you need to accept that it is part of your job. Something similar to the people who needs to attend two or three meetings every day and then realise that half of the day is gone. Well, you need to accept that those meetings are part of the job.

As I mentioned, for the long term I like to use [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) for project planning. There I can check the intermediate tasks and see the progress. For personal motivation, I use the **bullet journal** every beginning of week/month I plan specific *products* I would like to finish and every end of week/month I evaluate which products are ready.

For the every day, I use pretty much the Pomodoro technique. 
Basically, I work 25 minutes on that task with no distraction, no email, no internet.
Then I make a pause of 5 minutes and I work 25 minutes more, and so on. This forces me to 
plan what can I do those 25 min. and reminds me to stretch my muscles,
drink some water and walk around for a coffee or tea a couple of minutes. 
In this way my mind keeps fresh longer,
plus the effect of satisfaction when you achieve something, even if it is on 25 mins. I 
have found that this small goals I can mark as done every 
day are quite essential not to lose motivation.

I cannot control completely how many things I will finish in a day, but I can control how much time I spend completely focus on this task in front of the computer.

My personal objective is doing at least 12 pomodoros per day (6h), 
use 1h for meetings and 1 hour for answering emails.
And that makes my 8h. Notice that all those 8 hours (or some times even more) are  working time,
but I try to be focus on coding, writing or reading specific things at least 6h every day.
If you think it is not enough, try to track how much time you really spend working (not discussing with colleagues,
not attending to meetings, not answering emails, just working focus at your desk). You will be surprised ;-)


Last weeks, I have found thanks to the blog/podcast [UGeek](https://ugeek.github.io/) a new tool: [Tiddlywiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/). An experimental microcontent WikiWikiWeb. It's written in HTML and JavaScript to run on any browser without needing any serverside logic. The main advantage is that it works with a single html file. And I am trying to use it as **Journal** of the main project I am working on. It is quite practical in a similar way than org-mode, but more visual.

Thanks for reading and see you soon.

Santiago
