### Short Summary:

I mostly work doing Environmental Modelling, Scientific Programming and Data Analysis and Data Visualization
using Fortran, Python and R. I use always open source tools and I work using GNU/Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora).
I love using LaTeX for my documents, presentations and posters and I know a little bit of HTML/CSS, Matlab and C/C++

By the way, I am a native speaker in Spanish and Galician (similar to Portuguese), I speak English, 
I can express quite well in French and I can survive in German.
